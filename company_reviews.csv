1,"I couldn't make an official review on a product on the app so I came here, my mum bought my son an inflatable chair, it's very small, it deflates itself and eventually ends up with a hole in it, twice this has happened as my mum bought another to replace the first and yet again deflates itself and a hole was made in the exact same place coincidently. Its a bad product anyone who reads this remember ""paw patrol inflatable chair"" I expect products from argos to be more sustainable guess not...",1
2,"Great product, seemed to take an age to be delivered.",2
3,After 6 month still can't access my account,3
4,I got a couple of 30 day sim cards for my sons. At the store I was quoted an array of sims from different companies until I choose the right ones for me. 300 mins unlimited text and 10 GB data on id for ¬£10 a month. The staff were helpful and friendly and knew their stuff. Wasn't pressurised into buying things that I didn't need or want. Will be going back to carphone warehouse when my contract is up to get a better deal.,4
5,Very good value and a great tv very happy and delivery next day and free well done Hughes,5
6,So far annoyed as hell with this bt monthly pass. Its not easy as abc to get the app on TV. I want to watch on TV not on my phone. Not everyone is computer clever. Cant wait to cancel the damn thing. Why can't it be easy .,1
7,"Packing is a lot to be desired!
Ordered an SSD via the website, arrived in good time and at a good price, however, literally arrived wrapped in a paper bag, then an A5 card envelope. No bubble wrap or protective packaging. It's almost as though CEX want me to test out their 24month warranty. Seems to work for now. Hopefully it'll last it's course.
I was aiming to order some memory sticks at some point, but not sure I would trust them in the post after seeing what I received.",2
8,"It's a really good website if you want to buy cheap items but you need to find a trusted producer, try to buy something cheap then u can move up once you can rely on them",3
9,"ordered desktop computer- process for ordering was very easy to navigate and adapt to own preference. the main area for company to improve is as previously mentioned - keeping in touch- delays happen especially during these uncertain times and customers understand this but it is very frustrating when you have to chase updates with company rather than other way round. initial delivery ended up being over one month in reality which is fine is this is indicated rather than chased by customer, a simple note on your website might help- such as during these difficult times it may take up to one month then customers are aware from the outset.
PC works well and very happy with it- yes it was worth waiting for to get what we preferred so would use the company again and recommend",4
10,"Fantastic! Extremely easy to use website, fantastic range of batteries, fantastic packaging , dispatch and delivery service and all of that at fantastic prices! A first class company to deal with üëç",5
11,"Now Tv have the worst Broadband, it has gotten progressively worse and they refuse to up their quality. Do not join their services",1
12,Plenty of room for improvement. Haven't had the best experience From the very beginning. Lost usage of my tv areail once I invited them into my property. Only took out Internet as didn'twant to pay more for tv. Took months before I got a response to say nothing we could do. I still have no workingtv areailto this day! Would be nice if they phoned me every now and again to see if everything is ok. But you call them good luck if they speak English and or understand you.,2
13,Belt I ordered did not come on 48hr delivery as paid for.,3
14,Easy to order and great shoes . I have been looking for years for comfortable shoes which accommodate my bunion .,4
15,Correct replacement delivered on time now my vac is working again Thank you,5
16,This is by far the most shocking experience I‚Äôve ever had. I am a disabled person who made and order from Wing stop. Just like the many other orders I‚Äôve made over the years. Today the courier couldn‚Äôt get through to me? Even though I was in! They said they tried and tried. So they left the food outside. Who on earth leaves food outside. And to make things worse Deliveroo refuse to refund me for food I didn‚Äôt get. Sadly i dont have the funds for this. So am leaving this to warn people of this shocking and unacceptable behaviour Shame on you! Courier 1928 PS this is not a dis on WingStop. They‚Äôre Excellent .just dont use Deliveroo!!!!!!!!,1
17,"Bought 2 one for myself and one for my daughter as a present, so disappointed with mine which I was unable to return as I‚Äôd used it but immediately returned the second one. Whilst it straightens the bulk of your hair it doesn‚Äôt touch the ends, feels cumbersome to use and doesn‚Äôt glide through your hair like a normal brush. Would not recommend and will carry on with my ghd straighteners instead. Have just wasted my money.",2
18,Like ease of access to different aps,3
19,Halid S sorted my problem superfast and very efficiently,4
20,"Everything happened as you said, delivery great and on time, cannot fault whatsoever and will use again.",5

Hi there,

Thanks for getting back to me. May I please ask why this order can‚Äôt be refunded? Would this mean that the customer pays for the mistake of the restaurant?
Can‚Äôt Deliveroo simply offer credit as a gesture of good will to leave a customer happy and satisfied?

What's the point of a customer service team?...",1
22,"Hoover washing machine delivery.
Was told there is a thirteen step policy so couldn't deliver it ( They were sat buy there van smoking ) . They had phoned there boss who supposedly was not happy. After much negotiation they moved it half way and my son and I carried it the rest of the way . They also said they won't be taking the wrapper of or bolts out as they were late .",2
23,"I liked the way my item for repair was picked up and sent to repairer
I liked that I was told it would be reoaired.
I did not like the the lack of updates on progress
I did not like the fact that when the item was sent to manufacturer for repair that i recieved the notice that my item had been sent and recieved was very confusing as nothing came to me explaining what was going on.",3
24,Only one short gap in the service since installation.,4
25,"Quick and fast delivery. Website was easy to use, had no issues and came next day with free delivery.",5
26,I explained exactly what problem was when booking. Said heater wasn‚Äôt working. Engineer turned up without the part. Three days later still waiting for call back as to when they will return with the part to fix it,1
27,"2 stars as they did reply (Albeit unhelpful responses) to my emails and I did eventually receive a mended phone.
However. They advertised 48 hour turn around ( no mentioned of delays due to COVID as other companies had) and it was 11 days until I actually recieved it.
For the dishonest advertising I wouldn‚Äôt use again. It caused a lot of stress.",2
28,"The clothes I got for myself as adult is not good quality and ot already slacking, not good material, wasted money.",3
29,Fast Delivery . The Item purchased does the job . Many Thanks .,4
30,Easy instructions to follow on site & very efficient service. Quick delivery & good quality product,5
31,"More than a month after a technical fault in my area, I am still without a phone line or broadband. I've been on the phone more than a dozen times with them. BT keep giving me ""expected fix dates"", but no one ever shows up. I understand that these things may take time, but the constant lying is deplorable.",1
32,"All their wording is not succinct or to the point enough, they said my email would be here shortly with the print label on.",2
33,This is now our third switch in 4 years. Not happy with the quality of the product.,3
34,Staff are very friendly and helpful and noligabal,4
35,"Very pleasant experience today with both customer service and Tech support, Have had a couple of issues over the two years when speaking to customer service, but they have just been poorly trained or bad at the job!. 95% if the time it's 5 star service. Certainly compared to BT and Vodafone which are both terrible. Have renewed for another year hopefully will be hassle free again üôÇ",5
36,I did not receive the order and actually I would like to return it because I do no longer need it,1
37,"I bought a Fridgemaster fridge-freezer as a new 3 weeks ago.after home delivery,when I checked the fridge I seen some damage on the door ,not big damages just some cracks and bumps,I contacted with Argos and they offer me ¬£45 off from the price,I said yes. Than few days later I realized the back off the fridge is warm,I mean inside. I contacted again with Argos they sent an engineer,he did come and said the fridge has a major fault, should not be warm inside at all ,so he said because it's only 2 weeks old he advised to replace it. I contacted with Argos and they do not want to replace because I've got 45 pounds off from the price!!! I said them I send back that 45 but I need a new one.
After few days they send me an email they will give a new one to me. When I get the new and opening the box than I realized the first fridge what I've got probably was a refurbished one because that has much less packaging than the second one,even the main plug was uncovered and was tangled around the fridge compressor. :‚Å†-‚Å†\",2
38,Sick and tired of breaks in WiFi connection and prices going up without offering extra. Seriously looking at other suppliers.,3
39,Fast and easy to use Wright on the ball would definitely recommend to anyone will definitely use again,4
40,"Fast hassle free. Mean what they say and say what they mean. Would definitely recommend and will use them in the future.

41,Worst phone I have ever had can't wait till my contract ends so I can leave 3,1
42,"Problems with network in central area of UK, customer service wash their hands",2
43,"The iPod was in great condition, but they sent a multi connection charge cable with it, which doesnt support data transfer. I tried to explain this to them online, and they fobbed me off with a ""cosmetics"" excuse as to why they wouldn't exchange, or even send a data cable.
After buying my own data transfer cable, the iPod works great, veen the battery is holding well.",3
44,The only let down was royal mail give me a time slot in the morning and one slot in the evening. Royal mail was no help when asked which time was it.,4
45,Nice website. Easy to find what you want. Competitive pricing. Swift delivery. Careful packaging. Detailed installation instructions. Excellent after-sales support in the unlikely event it is needed.,5
46,Pictures are blurry on my photo book and part of my order hasn‚Äôt arrived!,1
47,"Price was great, service great however I spent way too long trying to order and pay from an iPhone when you can‚Äôt use an iPhone to complete the order, I needed a laptop this should have been clearer",2
48,I bought a laptop online and it was damaged. I called to store with the laptop and was told I had to return online. I contacted them and advised of damage and i wanted it replaced. I got refunded instead of replacement and had to call back to store to buy another one. Idid not think this was a good customer experience at all!!,3
49,It was positive overall. The only down side for me was the poor wi-fi signal at the store which is no fault of your own. It just made the experience a little grating. But overall it wouldn‚Äôt stop me from using the service again.,4
50,"Amazing company!
Really fast delivery
I purchased the GTech Pro and I have 4 pug dogs and it gets their hair up I am amazed! Will defiantly be purchasing more of GTech products",5
